Description: Provides functions to assess and test for complex heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker with respect to multiple baseline covariates, using both a parametric model and a semiparametric two-step model. More details are available in: Knowlton, R., Tian, L., & Parast, L. (2025). "A General Framework to Assess Complex Heterogeneity in the Strength of a Surrogate Marker," Statistics in Medicine, 44(5), e70001 <doi:10.1002/sim.70001>. Additionally, provides functions to assess complex heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker in observational settings using meta-learners, with options for different base learners. More details will be available in the future in: Knowlton, R., Parast, L. (2025) "Assessing Surrogate Heterogeneity in Real World Data Using Meta-Learners."
