Description: Provides functions to assess and test for complex heterogeneity in the utility of a surrogate marker with respect to multiple baseline covariates, using both a parametric model and a semiparametric two-step model. More details are available in: Knowlton, R., Tian, L., & Parast, L. (2025). "A General Framework to Assess Complex Heterogeneity in the Strength of a Surrogate Marker," Statistics in Medicine, 44(5), e70001 <doi:10.1002/sim.70001>.
